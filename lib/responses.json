    "response": "I completed a rigorous Digital Design program at UC DAAP from 2007-2012, during which I completed several required internships and began teaching myself to code. After graduation, I joined a start up called CoupSmart in Cincinnati, OH where I designed and developed apps on Facebook for ~2 years. When I moved to Denver in 2014 I accepted my current role at Deloitte Digital, which is a 100% engineering role. I haven't looked back since making the transition from designer to developer! At Deloitte Digital, I've learned so much in nearly 6 years, working on such a variety of apps and technologies for a diverse range of industries. I moved up the ranks from junior level and was recently promoted to a senior dev position :)"
